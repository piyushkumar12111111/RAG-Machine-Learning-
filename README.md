# RAG Machine Learning Model

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) machine learning model with a Flask backend and a Flutter frontend. The model leverages retrieval-based techniques to enhance the generation process, providing more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

## Features

- **RAG Model**: Combines retrieval and generation for improved performance.
- **Flask Backend**: Provides API endpoints for interacting with the model.
- **Flutter Frontend**: Offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable and maintainable codebase.

## Installation

### Backend Setup (Flask)

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-model.git
    cd rag-model/backend
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Flask Server**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

### Frontend Setup (Flutter)

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-model.git
    cd rag-model/frontend
    ```

2. **Install Flutter Dependencies**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the Flutter App**
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can interact with the RAG model through the Flutter application. The application provides an interface to input queries and receive generated responses augmented with relevant retrieved information.

1. **Start the Backend**
    Ensure the Flask server is running:
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

2. **Start the Frontend**
    Ensure the Flutter app is running:
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

3. **Interact with the App**
    Open the Flutter app on your emulator or physical device, enter your query, and receive responses from the RAG model.
